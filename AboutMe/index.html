        <h3> About my journey and Code Nation</h3>
        <img src="img/code nation.png" alt="Long Code Nation Logo">
        <p> Coding was not something I was familiar when I was growing up. I thought it was unattainable as you had to have a maths degree.
            However, once I found out about Code Nation and decided to try to code on my own, I got hooked. Since then, I got an Apprenticeship
            and here I am on a course learning how to code like a pro.

        <h3> What I would like to achieve this week. </h3>
        <p> Right now we are getting familiarised with HTML and CSS. This is why this abomination was created. In the future, thought, I am hoping to get better in understanding how to link all the different pages and to get better looking website, because right now it is quite rubish.</p>
